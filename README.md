# Face-recognition-with-opencv-for-python
You can perform fast, accurate face detection with OpenCV using a pre-trained deep learning face detector model shipped with the library.  You may already know that OpenCV ships out-of-the-box with pre-trained Haar cascades that can be used for face detection…  …but I’m willing to bet that you don’t know about the “hidden” deep learning-based face detector that has been part of OpenCV since OpenCV 3.3.  In the remainder of today’s blog post I’ll discuss:      Where this “hidden” deep learning face detector lives in the OpenCV library     How you can perform face detection in images using OpenCV and deep learning     How you can perform face detection in video using OpenCV and deep learning  As we’ll see, it’s easy to swap out Haar cascades for their more accurate deep learning face detector counterparts.
